			<h2>Cervical Foraminotomy</h2>

						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<dd>
							Anterior cervical microforminotomy (ACMF) was developed to preserve as much of the remaining disc in the intervertebral space as possible, while directly eliminating the compressive pathological lesion of the cervical spine. There are two ACMF approaches: original transuncal (TU) approach and upper vertebral transcorporeal (UVTC) approach The original transuncal approach required shaving to some degree of the lateral aspect of the intervertebral disc, so it could cause instability of the operated level or kyphotic change of the cervical spine. The UVTC approach was newly developed to minimize the impact on the remaining intervertebral disc and avoid accelerated degenerative change of the cervical spine. This operation is performed through a 6-7mm hole. The patient doesn't need any cervical brace after operation and return to work within 1 week. Possible complications and their preventative measures are identical to conventional anterior cervical procedures
